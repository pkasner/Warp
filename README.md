# Warp
## Game Idea
Warp is a dungeon crawler game, with the twist that every defeated enemy
will come back stronger after respawning somewhere else in the map.
Should you take out monsters now to make immediate tasks easier? 
Or should you try and skirt the line to save your future self the trouble?

## Todo
### Making a prototype:
Our first and most basic prototype should have the following features:
* Basic player movement
* Two rooms that the player can move between
* An enemy that warps rooms upon death
* A basic attack that can kill the enemy.
